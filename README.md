# Conway's Game of Life

Use `yarn start` to begin a game.

Certain parameters can be altered in the command line:

1. Live cell symbol - pass in any symbol (in single quotes ' ') or `ok` to use the default symbol.

2. Size of the board

3. Refresh rate

4. Type in a string of up to 5 letters! (WIP - still to be beautified)

i.e. `yarn start '*' 50 100 'hi!!!'`
